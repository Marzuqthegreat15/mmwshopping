        <p>
            A lot of people have goals like being  financialy rich, save money and so on.
            But, they also need to buy somethings like toys for their kids
            and other things. These are the things that are expesinve. If you 
            buy from my buisness, you will be spending less than you do by 20%.  
        </p>
        <h2 class="finances">Payment Finances</h2>
        <p>
            You will have to pay but depends on the item of choice. If you 
            buy something thats normally $20, you will not to pay for $20. Instead, you will pay 
            -5-10% off the $20!
